    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <h2>Object literals</h2>
    <p>
      Objects map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans,
      arrays and functions. If a property's value is a function, it is known as
      a method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects can be created two ways: const myVar = {} (object literal) or
      const myVar = new Object() (constructor function)
    </p>
    <p>
      Javascript tries to add two different data types if it can convert them, but this doesn't always work. 
      AVOID IT

    <p>"Falsy" values: "", '', ``, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, undefined</p>
    <p>Don't forget about the "delete" operator (deletes an item in an array BUT replaces it with undefined, does not make array shorter)</p>
    <p>"shift()" is "pop()" for the beginning of the array "unshift()" is "push()" for the beginning of the array</p>
    <p>See console for code examples.</p>

    <p>If you already have variable names that would be the same as the key in an object you can shorthand by just using the variable.</p>
    <p>can use dot notation or bracket notation to access object properties. Same for methods</p>
    <p>Can make objects that contain nested objects</p>
    <p>Objects are copied by reference</p>
    <p>DOM is a tree of nodes</p>

    <p>Very useful: document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll()</p>
    <p>classList.add for elements with multiple classes to add another one</p>
